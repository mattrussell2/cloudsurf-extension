# cloudsurf-extension

This repo holds the code for a google chrome extension that Matt Russell and Milo Shields are building.

Vision: We plan to release this extension in combination with a web platform to allow users to:
          1. Mark pages on the internet with "reacts", and be able to access their own reacted pages easily and intuitively.
          2. Augment the google search page with the aggregated reactions of
          cloudsurf users, allowing for people to intuitively trust or distrust sites.
          2. Be able to see the net product of everyone's data - that is, access the "most angry" or "most joyful" pages, based on aggregated tags.
          3. Be recommended new pages based on previous reaction history.

Version/Progress:
  We currently have page reaction functionality as well as google search augmentation
  functioning as intended.
